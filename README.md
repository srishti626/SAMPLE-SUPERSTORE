# Purpose:
Analyze sales data to identify trends, top-selling products, and revenue metrics for business decision-making.
Description: In this project, we will dive into a large sales dataset to extract valuable insights. We will explore sales trends over time, identify the best-selling products, calculate revenue metrics such as total sales and profit margins, and create visualizations to present your findings effectively. This project showcases your ability to manipulate and derive insights from large datasets, enabling you to make data-driven recommendations for optimizing sales strategies.
 
# About Dataset
This dataset is about sample superstore with 
Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes
based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed
on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females
at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.2
From the data set in the (.csv) File We can find several variables, some of them are independent
(several medical predictor variables) and only one target dependent variable (Outcome).
